how's that alright so so moving on from here we talked a little bit about silk and how spiders use silk for lots of reasons and the silk comes out of the spinnerets which are there on the abdomen and if you zoom in there a little spigot each spigot of witches specialized to produce a certain kind of silk that has a certain function right I think we didn't talk about that and male spiders are modified for sperm delivery that's not where the sperm is made the sperm is made actually down by the abdomen

Furman then goes out looking for a love the female genitalia is internal but there's some external Parts in most spiders and there's all kinds of courtship that you can imagine happens all kinds of crazy behaviors and lots of examples right there is lots and lots of species to lots of variation eggs are put into an egg sac and then protected by the female

they don't have quite the same sort of theme that the plants do and then know which is sort of scattered and lots of little many things do you agree yeah and so what do you think about the animals it's not like there are small little things to help you so what I'm going to do is this

not easy I'm not going to post a key but X number of those questions are going to be on your final hundred percent right I'm going to copy and paste into your final exam and your final exam I have been thinking about it's going to be a little bit

I thought that would go over well alright so on we go we are in protostomes we are still not out of protostomes or it will still in protostomes is only for lectures

if you look closely the purple. Izakaya sozai ecdysozoa include pan arthropods and it includes nematodes nematodes of the orange light orange. And then you have this. Which includes a subset of pan arthropods which most people would call the true or you arthropods or right pods and hexapods

start: 1493.6468027210885	end: 1520.9534693877551
we are going to talk about hexapods and malacostracans both of which belong to this group was used to be called well subset of what was once called crustacea but now we're talkin about pancrustacea because as we discovered last time hexapods are crustaceans to there just Crustaceans that live on land right so insects are the Crustaceans of the

start: 1523.7863038548753	end: 1541.5727891156462
this group is super super super divert it's like impossible to summarize it all in just one lecture year familiar with these animals most of most of them anyway the one that maybe is a little bit odd is number two that's the barnacle syrupy

start: 1545.9381405895692	end: 1551.5573696145125
but the other two malacostracans and hexapods you know

start: 1555.7369614512472	end: 1564.51410430839
what about the malacostracans there's a lot of species at least 50,000 they can be Marine freshwater and terrestrial

start: 1580.2107936507937	end: 1586.9445804988661
but they also include things that are like crabs with some of which spend some of their time and the ocean and some of the time online

start: 1592.2851700680271	end: 1611.650612244898
lots of different feeding strategies as you can imagine from a group this diverse one thing that separates them is that they have this body plan with three tagmata so they have a head thorax and abdomen but the head and the thorax are fused and that Fusion is called a Cara

mayhap two pairs of antennae which is in contrast to Insects which have one pair of antennae so subtle difference but you get the main idea

start: 1632.084172335601	end: 1691.4343764172336
awesome cool examples that I think I should stand out to you probably the most amazing one is the mantis shrimp so there's no other lots of examples of these guys I mean with so many species but this is one that stands out to me and the theme here that idea here is that malacostracans have and many ways modified their limbs and appendages to be highly specialized and so mantis shrimp in addition to having really really good Vision where the eyes can freely rotate drawn stocks they also have appendages that are modified and so with a mantis shrimp alone there's two big kinds of hunting strategy stabbing

start: 1691.4343764172336	end: 1748.2303854875283
and the Smashing ones they have appendages that have what look like little boxing gloves on the end but this is really really dense hard chitin and what they do is to stun their prey they hit them really really really hard and so this is again one of these super-fast biological mechanisms and when this happens you it creates cavitation bubbles in the water such that it actually generates heat and light it's that it's that fast it's really amazing

are they used to punch the crap out of basically everything they have the fastest punch in the world with the same acceleration as a 22 caliber bullet do a mantis shrimp kung fu looks like it the man Distributing deliver a blow with 15 Newtons of force which county in must have had that punches so powerful that the universe

yeah that's a trilobite I don't okay alright are filter feeders

start: 2058.4025396825396	end: 2076.189024943311
usually you find them in shallow water but sometimes they can mean a little deeper water but really cool thing about them is that they're sequential hermaphrodites what is this mean so sometimes or males and then they can switch to females and then they

start: 2080.2757369614515	end: 2089.795918367347
now here's the tricky part it says soil many have internal fertilization

start: 2092.0250340136054	end: 2107.582403628118
furtive you might you know think about how that might work if you cannot move yet you have internal fertilization how is that supposed to work right that you've got to somehow get the parts together

start: 2109.7186394557825	end: 2164.2390929705216
so you want to think about how they might do that and the answer is sort of PG-13 and then slightly disturbing and that is that when sometimes they just can have external fertilization so they release sperm into the water but other times they have a really gigantic Lee long penis that they extend and sort of like tap all the Barnacles around them because looking for hey are you home how's it going right and so this is how they accomplished

start: 2167.304126984127	end: 2173.527074829932
okay hexapods holy smokes insects this is pan arthropod

start: 2177.4280272108845	end: 2187.5054875283445
that's hexapods insects are the dominant animal group on

start: 2191.8243990929705	end: 2215.9267120181407
and as you can imagine they serve do everything but just three orders of insects account for 50% of described animal diversity lepidoptera butterflies and moths hymenoptera ants bees and wasps and coleoptrata the Beatles flies are close

start: 2220.802902494331	end: 2243.744217687075
so good theme a good question a good ideas why Why are insects so successful that's crazy they have three three pairs of legs

start: 2251.360362811791	end: 2276.019954648526
no respirations interesting they have something called a tracheal system and what this means is on the outside of an insect's body they have openings little holes and those holes are called spiracles and each hole represent the outside opening to an extension of internal tube

start: 2279.9673469387753	end: 2291.5773242630385
and that fine network of internal tubes extends throughout the entire body that don't have lungs they have this fine network of tubes called tracheal system

start: 2295.292517006803	end: 2311.500045351474
and the tree key deliver oxygen directly to sell so what I mean by that is the trachea or not exactly tied to one cell the 3rd of go to sort of a general area of cells and you have diffusion of oxygen to that are

start: 2313.9149206349207	end: 2316.3762358276645
here's a close-up picture of what a spiracle look

start: 2319.534149659864	end: 2323.899501133787
the quite a bit different in terms of respiration than what you might expect

start: 2327.8468934240364	end: 2374.983401360544
they have a lots of different mouthparts I think this is one key to their success has lots of specialization and evidence for that is they have specialized mouthparts to do certain jobs they're biting chewing mouthparts like you might find in a lot of Beatles there's piercing sucking mouthparts like he might find a mosquito or they're siphoning mouthparts which and then

start: 2383.2032653061224	end: 2425.7886621315192
so thinking about the mouthparts we into first talked about this group isn't of neethu instead neethu and what this means and this is not exactly a monophyletic group these are insects that have internalized mouthparts people don't often see these but I bring them bring his up for really important reason in that important reason is that these are insects that are essentially sister to the rest of the insect lineage and they're really small many of them are blinds they have internal mouthparts but they don't have a fundamental feature that you associate with insects

start: 2428.249977324263	end: 2438.048798185941
really not have wings they don't have wings they can't fly but it's so not all insects can

start: 2440.695873015873	end: 2458.2965986394556
these guys don't have them they have all kinds of other amazing capabilities the pleura and usually only find in deep soil habitats in caves collembola you can find lots of places and they have a spring basically that can fling them really really really far

start: 2463.8693877551023	end: 2472.925170068027
so leaving behind those keeping that in mind we're going to the paleoptera here is where we get the evolution of wing

start: 2475.340045351474	end: 2482.6311111111113
know the evolution of flight is not homologous among animals this is a great thing

start: 2484.7673469387755	end: 2500.5569160997734
flight has evolved multiple times in animals can we think of where bats heard that or else insects where else Birds where else

reptiles getting warmer not where we said that we have bats we have insects we have birds and we have think of an extinct one yeah pterodactyl pterosaurs so flight in animals has evolve four times so it's not homologous but the flight that is in insects is homologous So within insects flight evolve one time but it's been lost a lot a lot of insect groups have watched the ability to

paleo Travis versus neopterin so two groups write these guys are different from the Opera which includes most of the insects do you know because paleo after up can fold their wings vertically on top of their body mostly them can't fold their wings at all but you get the idea so two different ways of folding Wings paleo after the ones that folder Wings on top straight up in the air
