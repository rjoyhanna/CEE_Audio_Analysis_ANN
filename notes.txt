Standardizing the data had no effect

* try not scaling?
* only scale the fourier data?
* fix edge cases for labels
* clean up code
* make surrounding window smaller?
* provide with other data?
*   - mean of clip
*   - sd of surrounding window

* mean_sd6.pickle is all -1 labels
* mean_sd5.pickle is standardized window size of 5
* mean_sd4.pickle is standardized? window size of 10


TRY giving the mean and sd of the entire clip as well (same vlaue for each clip of the same audio file)
